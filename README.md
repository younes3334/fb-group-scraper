# Facebook Group Posts scraper
Hello !
Thanks for reading this guide for the code !

**First**: if you do not have the necceray libraries for the work, you will need to install the requirements by running the following in your terminal:  
   => pip install -r requirements.txt

**Secondly** :  
=> You need to input the **group link** to scrape.  
=> Then, you need to enter how many posts you want to scrap from tha group.  

**Finally**:  
Run the script and let the code do the work !!!  
    => it automatically open the browser and scrap the posts from the group .  
    => after it finish, it will save the **collected data** in an Excel file with the name of the group.  

**Note**:  
    - You can remove the " # " in the line 112 so it will be headless (that means the code will run and do the work whithout opening the browser).  
    - I've used the "undected_chromedriver" library so Facebook do not detecte and automation action and block the script .  
  

Thanks for your attention !  
Feel free to ask me any question !
